```{r}

```{r}

There appears to be a positive association between points and salary.

```{r}

```{r}

```{r}

```

```{r}
var_x <- (1/(n-1))*sum((points - mean_x)^2)

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
sd_x = sqrt(var_x)

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
cov_xy = (1/(n-1))*sum((points - mean_x)*(salary - mean_y))

```

```{r}
cor_xy = cov_xy/(sd_x*sd_y)
cor_xy
```
```{r}
b_1 <- cor_xy * (sd_y/sd_x)
b_0 <- mean_y - b_1*(mean_x)
y_hat <- b_0 + b_1*(points)

point_vector <- c(0, 100, 500, 1000, 2000)
predicted_values <- b_0 + b_1*(point_vector)
```
*How do you interpret the slope coefficient?* - If the number of points increases by 1, then the salary increases by approximately $8556.68

*How do you interpret the intercept term?* - If the number of points is 0, then the salary of the player is predicted to be $1,509,886

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
